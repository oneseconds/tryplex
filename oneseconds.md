# Oneseconds #

Oneseconds consists of three artists, two interaction designers and a film maker. We build and program our own unique video instruments and installations. We perform live in clubs, theatres, museums, build installations and act as mediators between art and technology.<br><br>

Sebastian Kox is an interaction artist who finished Interaction Design at the art-academy of Utrecht in 2008. In the last two years of his study he started to investigate the possibilities of combining interaction design with theatrical experiences. After a year at Dogtroep, a location based theatre group, and currently involved with PIPS:lab and oneseconds he experiments with public interaction, live video generation and video mutilation. Quartz composer let's him program with a expressionistic style, experimenting with various custom made tools that let him, or the audience, express itself.<br>
